# TODO list
 
## High-priority list

1. + Add Cronicle admin password configuration to install.sh
1. + Expand default Cronicle user rights to include on-demand task running 

## Low-priority list

1. Block 3012 port when HTTPS is enabled on Cronicle
1. Add Cronicle link to launcher and menu of Jupyter Lab. That would help to get rid of start page. Some useful doc links should be added too.
1. Add Jupyter execution plugin to Cronicle - in this case it would not be mandatory for a user to know papermill syntax.

## Known issues

1. Cronicle restarts when adding users. There is currently no way to fix this until Cronicle 2 is out.
